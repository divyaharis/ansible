Tags in Ansible
=======================
Tags are used to get more modular control on the execution
of the playbooks

vim playbook14.yml
---
- name: Implementing tags
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: Install tree
     apt:
      name: tree
      state: present
     tags: tree_installation
   - name: Create user
     user:
      name: Ravi
      password: levelup
     tags: user_creation
   - name: Copy /etc/passwd file
     copy:
      src: /etc/passwd
      dest: /tmp
...

To execute only the the tagged modules
ansible-playbook playbook14.yml --tags=tagged -b

To execute only the untagged modules
ansible-playbook playbook14.yml --tags=untagged -b

To execute modules with a specific tag name
ansible-playbook playbook14.yml --tags=user_creation -b

===================================================================
When conditions
======================
These are similar to "if" condiotions ie we want to execute
a module when a specific condition is true

---
- name: Implementing when conditions
  hosts: all
  vars:
   - a: 10
  tasks:
   - name: Download from git
     git:
      repo: git-url
      dest: /tmp/git
     when: a == 10 
...


=======================================================================
---
- name: Check if file f1 is present if not create a folder f1
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: check if f1 file is present
     stat:
      path: /tmp/f1
     register: a
   - name: Display output of the above module
     debug:
      var: a
   - name: Create dir f1 if file f1 is not present
     file:
      name: /tmp/f1
      state: directory
     when: a.stat.exists == false
...
==========================================================
Handlers
================
1 Handlers are modules that are executed if some other module 
  is executed successfully and it has made some changes

2 Handlers are executed only after all the tasks are executed

3 Handlers are executed in the order that they are mentioned 
  in the handlers section and not in the order that they are
  called in the tasks section

4 Even if a handler is called multiple times in the task section
  it will be executed only once

vim playbook17.yml
---
- name: Implementing Handlers
  hosts: all
  tasks:
   - name: Install apache2
     apt:
      name: apache2
      state: present
     notify: Check url response
   - name: Edit the index.html file
     copy:
      content: "IntelliQIT Home Page"
      dest: /var/www/html/index.html
     notify: Restart apache2
  handlers:
   - name: Restart apache2
     service:
      name: apache2
      state: restarted
   - name: Check url response
     uri:
      url: "{{item}}"
      status_code: 200
     with_items:
      - http://172.31.95.178
      - http://172.31.88.236
